# First steps

In this set of articles, you'll learn the **core fundamentals** to be able to use the Lua API.

When `veiled-client` is started for the first time, the `veiled` folder is created under `~/.local/share/`.
This contains two more directories, `configs` and `scripts` as well as the entry point, `veiled.lua`.

## Prerequisites

[url_vscode]: https://code.visualstudio.com/
[url_atom]: https://atom.io/
[url_sublime]: https://www.sublimetext.com/

You only need a simple text editor. [VSCode][url_vscode] is recommended, but there is nothing wrong with alternatives such as [Atom][url_atom], [Sublime][url_sublime] or any other editor.
